## Large Language Models (LLM's)

Using LLM's are great for getting information into your brain, but not for code in your editor.

We do not accept code generated by AI.

You may use it as a search engine, to understand your problems and solutions.

You may not use it to write the code for you.

Copying code without typing it out yourself is prohibited.

I enjoy enough AI slop at work, I don't need to bring it home and show everyone too.
